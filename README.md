# Set Adventure 3
A modern SET object editor for modding the Sonic Adventure series. Inspired by the original [Set Adventure 1.2 by TurtleMan64](https://github.com/TurtleMan64/SetAdventure), this editor allows you to create and modify objects, enemies, and more for levels in Sonic Adventure 1 and 2.

## Features
* A modern, sleek interface powered by material design.
* Simple interactions by using an Object-based approach.
* Smart attributes that get renamed depending on the type of object.
    * *(Example, var1 converts into 'Spring Force')*
* Easy to create, modify, and delete objects.

## Stretch Goals (WIP)
* Allow exporting to txt
* Allow importing txt
* Multi-level object list support
* Raw View
* Visualizations (?)
